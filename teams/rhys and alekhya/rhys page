<p>
    hello we're Alekhya and Rhys we are trying to building a strong bridge for a school project.
    or goal is to make a bridge with the constraints where given
    like it has to be 10cm or less wide . the hight as to be 20cm or less and the lenght has to be 50- 60 cm.
    We were also only givin 125g of spagetti and 5 hot glue sticks
 
        <img src="IMG_2618.jpg" width=120>
     this is the view through the middle of the bridge
    <img src="IMG_2619.jpg" width=200px>
    this is the arial view  of the bridge
    <img src="IMG_2620.jpg" width=200px>
    this is the view of the bottom of our bridge
   
        </p>
        <h3 style="background-color:lightcyan;">How It Failed</h3>
        <p>
        the bridge was over the with limit which was a facture of why it failed
        but we also need to make it stronger in the middle
        </p>
        <h3 style="background-color:lightcyan;">Summary</h3>
       
        <p>
          in our first test we found out we can make some superts thinner.
        we also need to figure out a way to make the center stronger.
